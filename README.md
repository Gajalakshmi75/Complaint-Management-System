# ABSTRACT

Complaint Management System 

The complaint management system is a user-friendly and efficient solution for handling complaints on campus. It makes it easy for students, faculty, and staff to report their problems and track their progress. This system aims to improve communication and accountability by automating the complaint registration process. By centralizing and digitizing the complaint management system, it promotes fairness, timeliness, and effective resolution of campus-related issues. Instead of using paper forms, users can submit their complaints online, saving time and reducing paperwork. The system categorizes complaints based on their nature, urgency, and the department involved, ensuring that they are quickly and appropriately addressed. Administrators can access a centralized database of complaints, allowing them to easily monitor the status of each complaint. Real-time updates keep everyone informed about the progress.
